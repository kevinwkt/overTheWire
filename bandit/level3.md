# Level 3

First we do ```ls``` and notice that there's a single file called "spaces in this filename".  
We ```cat``` this by taking into account the spaces like the following: "spaces\ in\ this\ filename"  

Finally, we enter bandit3 the same way as before with the password gotten above:  

```ssh -p 2220 bandit3@bandit.labs.overthewire.org```
