# overTheWire  

This will be my journey in completing the simple challenges in Over the Wire (http://overthewire.org/wargames/)

## Bandit  

This is a week-long challenge where I will learn on the fly while I try to complete these "simple" challenges. I will also write a python script for each challenge to automate everything for those who want to "test" my scripts.  

Warning: Because of my lack of experience my bash scripts and the python scripts will be messy and might be inefficient.
