# overTheWire  

This will be my journey in completing the simple challenges in Over the Wire (http://overthewire.org/wargames/)

## Bandit  

This is a week-long challenge where I will learn on the fly while I try to complete these "simple" challenges. I will also write a python script for each challenge to automate everything for those who want to "test" my scripts.  

Warning: Because of my lack of experience my bash scripts and the python scripts will be messy and might be inefficient. 

Requisits: *pwn* installed for python2  

Status: Stopped after bandit27->bandit28 since I didn't want to do ```git``` challenges for now. Possibly will come back in the future.

## Leviathan  

This is a few-days challenge where I will improvise as I go, see what happens.

So I gave it a pause after the first challenge due to me being blocked. I decided to work on krypton before this one just to clear up my mind.

## Krypton

Like written above, I will focus on solving Krypton since I am blocked on Leviathan. Estimated time of completion is still unknown since I haven't read the challenges yet.
